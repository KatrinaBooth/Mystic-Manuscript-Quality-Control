<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is the final assignment for the Technology Essentials module at Digital Futures Academy. Over 1.5 days, I successfully imported a dataset from Mystic Manuscripts into an SQL database, ensuring a solid foundation for further analysis. I conducted thorough error identification and quality control checks to detect inconsistencies, such as missing values, duplicates, and incorrect entries. Throughout the process, I collaborated with the client and important stakeholders to clarify anomalies and refine the dataset.

Additionally, I documented the entire process, providing detailed SQL code for table creation and quality control checks. I concluded the project by completing a Quality Control Form, certifying that the dataset was fully validated and ready for analysis.

The following deliverables were expected:

* SQL code showcasing table creation, as well as any updated/alterations.
* SQL code showcasing quality control checks. This excludes queries 1 - 7.
* Quality control form referencing the checks that have been carried out.
